## Introduction

My project here will be focused around Car Accidents asking questions such as which make(brand) of cars gets into the most accidents? How old were the drivers involved in the accidents? does age and the make of the car have a correlation between them? my goal of this project is to find out the top car makes and the demographics of the people involved in those accidents in the country and states and what caused the accident in the first place?. I believe this is important in order to address a further investigation into this concern of mine and find solutions in order to attempt to stop tragedies that take the lives of thousands of Americans every year. ML can help us in this case by finding trends, patterns, and risk factors in the car's make and the demographic of the person in collected data sets

I created this graph in powerpoint using information from https://www.lendingtree.com/ that shows the the most common car make in accidents in the United States, It shows us that among the top 5 is Ram, Tesla, Subaru, Volkswagen, and Mazda as the most common car makes to be in an accident. But with this image alone doesn't tell us much. It only tells us the most common makes and not other information such as where the accidents happen?, who was the driver?, was the driver under the influence of any substances? and many other important information that is not shown here. But this is a 1st step and one of many in order to reach my end goal of the most common characteristics of a car accident.
